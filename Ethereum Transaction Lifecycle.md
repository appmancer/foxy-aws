# **Ethereum Transaction Lifecycle Data Model (Optimism-Compatible)**

## **Transaction Lifecycle States**

### **Core Transaction States for ETH Transfers:**

1. **Created** â€“ Transaction intent is created but not yet signed.
2. **Signed** â€“ Transaction is signed by the user's wallet.
3. **Broadcasted** â€“ Signed transaction is sent to the network.
4. **Pending** â€“ Transaction is waiting for confirmation (in mempool).
5. **Confirmed** â€“ Transaction is mined and has at least 1 confirmation. This is the state in Foxy where we consider the transaction to have been settled.
6. **Finalized** â€“ Transaction has multiple confirmations and is immutable.
7. **Failed** â€“ Transaction failed due to an error (e.g., out of gas).
8. **Cancelled** â€“ Transaction was replaced or canceled.
9. **Error** â€“ System-level error occurred (network issue, timeout).

## Narrative Transaction Flow

The following is a detailed narrative of the transaction lifecycle within the Foxy system:

1. **User Initiates a Transaction Request (Client)**  
   The user opens the Foxy mobile app and selects a recipient and the amount to send. Upon confirming the payment, the app drafts a **Transaction Request** containing the transaction details (amount, recipient address, token type) and securely sends this request to the **Rust API backend**.

2. **Backend Validates and Logs the Request (API â†’ DynamoDB)**  
   The backend API receives the request, authenticates the user via JWT and device fingerprint, and creates a new entry in the **DynamoDB Transaction Request Table**. The transaction is marked with the status `Requested`. The backend returns the **RequestID** to the client for further processing.

3. **User Signs the Transaction (Client)**  
   The client app receives the `RequestID`, prompts the user to confirm the transaction, and **signs the transaction** locally using the private key stored securely on the device. The signed transaction is sent back to the backend.

4. **Backend Updates the Transaction State (API â†’ DynamoDB)**  
   The backend receives the **signed transaction**, verifies its integrity, and updates the corresponding DynamoDB record to `Signed`. The signed payload is stored, and this change triggers the DynamoDB **Streams**.

5. **DynamoDB Stream Triggers Processing (DynamoDB â†’ SQS â†’ Lambda)**  
   DynamoDB Streams detect the state change and push the signed transaction into the **SQS Queue**. This decouples the signing from processing, allowing the system to scale.

6. **Lambda Picks Up and Broadcasts the Transaction (Lambda â†’ Optimism)**  
   A dedicated **Lambda function** listens to the SQS queue. It retrieves the signed transaction and broadcasts it to the **Optimism network**. If successful, the transaction status in DynamoDB is updated to `Broadcasted` and then progresses to `Pending` as it awaits confirmation.

7. **Transaction Confirmation and Finalization (Optimism â†’ Lambda â†’ DynamoDB)**  
   The Lambda function polls the Optimism network to monitor the transaction's progress. Once the transaction is mined, the status is updated to `Confirmed`. After sufficient confirmations, it is marked as `Finalized`.

8. **Error Handling and Retries**  
   If broadcasting fails (due to network issues or invalid transactions), the Lambda updates the status to `Failed` and logs the error in `ErrorMessage`. The system automatically retries broadcasting up to the maximum defined in the `Retries` field.

9. **User Notification**  
   The user is notified in the app once the transaction reaches a terminal state (`Confirmed`, `Failed`, or `Cancelled`).

## DynamoDB Data Model**

### **Event Store Table (`Transactions`)**

A **Transaction Request** in Foxy represents a user's intent to send funds on the Optimism network. This request moves through multiple states, reflecting both internal processing and external blockchain events. The system ensures a non-custodial model where signing is performed on the client device, and the backend manages validation, queuing, and broadcasting.

## **4. Transaction Lifecycle Workflow**

1. **User Initiates Transfer â†’ `Created`**
2. **Wallet Signs Transaction â†’ `Signed`**
3. **Broadcast to Network â†’ `Broadcasted`**
4. **Await Confirmation â†’ `Pending` â†’ `Confirmed`/`Failed`**
5. **Update Materialized View** with balance or status.

---

## **5. Additional States for Layer 2 (Optimism)**

- **Deposited** â†’ Funds have been bridged from Layer 1 (Ethereum) to Layer 2 (Optimism) but are not yet available for use due to the settlement process.
- **Finalizing** â†’ The transaction is in the fraud-proof window specific to Optimism rollups, ensuring no malicious activity has occurred before final confirmation.
- **Withdrawn** â†’ Funds have been withdrawn from Layer 2 back to Layer 1, awaiting final settlement on the main Ethereum network.
- **Challenge Period** â†’ The transaction is being challenged or validated within the fraud-proof period, common in optimistic rollups.
- **Bridging** â†’ Indicates an ongoing cross-chain transfer between L1 and L2 or between different L2s.
